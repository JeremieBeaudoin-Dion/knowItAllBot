,"When you cast the spell, then sit down and start talking, each creature able to understand your language and hear you talking with any clarity must take no other action than sitting down and listening to you, captivated by your words. This effect remains active as long as you keep talking with no pause of more than two seconds. Creatures entering the effect after it has started are not subjected to it. Once every duration, on their turn, any affected creature can try a Wisdom defense against your Influence Score to end the effect of the spell on them. When a creature previously affected by the spell takes an action other than sitting down, is moved or is threatened, the spell's effect stops for everyone. At the start of the spell, you can modulate the volume of your voice to encompass a larger or smaller area. Creatures that succeeded on a Wisdom defense realise the effect was supernatural. The others can only use their normal judgement to determine that.",,,,,,,,

,"When you cast this spell, you must speak out loud some insult or hurtful words about a person. Those words must be something with which they might indentify on some level. The power of the insult depends on whether it is generic (understandable by someone interacting with them for the first time), personnal (understandable by someone who knows them) or intimate (known only people close to them). If the person is in range, the spell afflicts them with a burning headache. That headache gives them -1, -2 or -3 to all actions and defenses and deals 1+1D, 2+2D or 3+3D damage at the onset and every 10 minutes afterward. The headache subsides after 5 minutes of total calm in a soothing environment. The person affected by the spell can try, when they choose, once every ten minutes, to make a Resolve defense against 6, 7, 8 to ignore the drawback of the headache for 30 seconds.",,,,,,,,

,Focus:,"Any black iron item with the ""closed eye"" symbol drawn on it",,,,,,Cost:,4
,Difficulty:,10,Sorcery Score plus four,,,,,,
,"This spell can be casted as a quick action but still counts toward your maximum of one spell per round. When you cast this spell, touch your spell focus while you see someone cast a spell of Noble Magic, Wild Magic or Blood Magic, you may make a defense with the prescribed target against the Sorcery Score of the caster. If you succeed, any effect directly aimed at you or directly enchanting you from that spell is cancelled for the entirety of its duration. This doesn't affect most elemental damage that happen to hit you, but affects most mental effects, all spells targetting you directly, all alterations on yourself, etc... It nullifies the will of any summoned creature, plant or object to harm you precisely but doesn't stop physical things created or called through magic to interact with your body normally.",,,,,,,,

,Focus:,The ingredients,,,,,,Cost:,3
,Healing:,5,Half of Sorcercy Score plus two,,,,,,
,"When you cast this spell, pour a portion of fragrant poultice into the wounds of a creature. If you do so while trying to stabilize their wounds, you gain +2 to your Science roll to do so. After that, you must let the poultice in place four 48 hours. At the end of that period, if the poultice was applied correctly and the wound onto which it was administered was stable and the mixture wasn't washed away by friction or water, the character is healed some Health. A single creature can't benefit from the healing of more that one poultice at a time.
The poultice is a concoction that needs basic cooking utensils to prepare. It takes a base time of 10 minutes to assemble and requires the following ingredients: wet clay, cabbage leaves, darkroot shavings and fragrant laurel leaves. The Science roll difficulty required to prepare it is 3.",,,,,,,,

,"When you cast this spell, you can draw the likeness of a knife on a person's skin with the piece of charcoal. It stays there permanently as a tattoo. Whenever they want, that creature can touch the drawing and summon a black obsidian knife from it. It is very sharp and short but very brittle, and becomes fragile after hitting hard surfaces a number of times. It has the same characteristics as normal knife otherwise, but when fragile, it has a 2/3rds probability of breaking with any impact. Drawing the blade makes the tattoo vanish. A person can only have one black blade drawn on them at once.",,,,,,,,

While in the area, they receive a -2 penalty to all rolls associated with actions other than try to get away from it. The candle loses its effect once once blown out, regardless of the duration.

,Range:,12,Two meters times Sorcery Score,,,,,,
,"When you cast this spell, all creatures within a 5 meter radius circle centered in range must make a Size defense. Those that fail start violently retching a thick black substance. While they are, they are considered distracted and can take no other action that a single quick action on their turn. At the end of their turn, they receive 1+1D Morale damage, spend 15 Stamina (affected by Adrenalin) and go back to normal. Whether they succeed or fail on their defense, all creatures affected become nauseous (-1 to most proactive rolls of Fighting, Athletics, Acrobatics, Wrestling, Aim and Running). They can choose, on their turn, to spend the turn retching to end the effect. After each turn spent nauseous but not retching, they lose 1 Health, 1 Morale and 1 Stamina.",,,,,,,,

You gain as much Stamina as they lost (you don't benefit from the negative values of creatures below 13 Stamina). This effect can allow you to receive more than your maximum Stamina, but at the end of your next turn, it goes down to your maximum.

,"When you cast this spell then touch a one meter radius circle drawn on the ground, you enchant it. Until dusk, the circle faintly glows red. Any creature standing within it suffers immense pain, receiving 1+1D Morale damage each turn. It must make a Resolve defense against each turn to avoid writhing on the ground in pain. After a character loses a total of 20 Morale or more from continued exposure to this effect, they become numb, unable to feel pain. They are immune to pain related Morale loss or compulsive behavior and don't suffer penalties from level 1 limb Wounds. This effect lasts a number of weeks equal to your Sorcery Score plus their Resolve value.",,,,,,,,
