,Blessing awarded to Acolytes,,,,,,,,,,,
,"A swarm of of butterflies and other metamorphosing insects gathers around you peacefully. It requires one hour to form when scattered or destroyed. While in nature, it grows to occupy six spaces (2 meter hexes). While in cities, it stays at only three spaces. It usually follows you, but you can use a quick action to mentally order it to move. It can move up to 8 meters a turn. You can order each individual space to move separately. Most proactive physical actions are done with a +1 to difficulty when done from inside a space occupied by the swarm. You can also order the swarm to merge three spaces into one. That concentrated space blocks line of sight and is considered a first level difficult terrain in addition to the normal penalty. The swarm acts as soon as you order it. You lose control of the swarm when you are separated by more than 20 meters.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"When you look someone in the eyes, you may weave a dream in their mind. The next time they get into deep sleep within 24 hours, they will dream that dream, an nothing else. The dream can be anything you choose, including no dream at all. You can offer a peaceful dream that recrates 1 point of Morale regeneration that would have been lost by short or uncomfortable sleep, or offer a dreadful nightmare that reduces the Morale regenerated by 1. You can create this effect up to once per Wisdom point between full nights of sleep. You can affect yourself with this effect by looking into a reflective surface.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"Whenever you want, you can roll up into a ball and spend an hour inside a silk cocoon that forms around you. When you come out, you've transformed into another member of your species. That form stays until you transform again or breaks down in 15 minutes after the blessing is lost. During the transformation, you may lose 1 point in any body Attribute and gain one point in an other one. You are infertile when transformed and the process is impossible to attempt while pregnant. The transformation fully changes your body and voice. To immitate the appearance of a specific individual, you must know it very well. You must make a Lore roll to immitate them. The difficulty depends on your familiarity with their appearance (from 3 to 9).",,,,,,,,,,,

Your wordly spells and blessings only cost/require one and a half times the Morale (rounded down) when you are in the Faerie rather than twice as much. You can speak and understand the languages of the Fae. The first time a thinking Fae creature attacks or casts a spell on you, they are hit by Nirion's Smite (15D+15 internal damage). This effect can't trigger more than once in a 24 hour period. The Fae feel the threat of the smite.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"When you touch a creature, you may sacrifice this blessing to infect them with Nirion's Oneiric Plague. Within ten minutes and each hour after that, they must make an immunity defense (with a base number of 6) against 7 to avoid falling asleep for an hour. Whenever they sleep for four consecutive hours, they receive a permanent random mutation that reduces a random attribute by 1. Whenever an attribute goes to 0, they die. Creatures afflicted by the Oneiric Plague are only contagious while they are sleeping and can only infect other creatures of their species. Acolytes, Clerics and Oracles of Nirion are never infected by the disease. Vulnerable creatures that touch the diseased sleeper must make an immunity defense against 3, 5 and 7 for a brief (less than 2 seconds), sustained (less than 2 minutes) or prolonged touch. If the defense is a failure, they contract the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"When someone (including you) drinks alcohol poured in their mouth by yourself, they instantly recover their Adrenalin value in Stamina for each dose of alcohol they ingest.

,Blessing awarded to Clerics,,,,,,,,,,,
,"When you put a few drops of your blood into wine then bottle it and let it sit for two weeks, it becomes bloodwine. Your bloodwine remains bloodwine forever but only has magical properties while this blessing is active. When you try to create of your bloodwine than there is blood in your body, the oldest turns to vinegar and loses any special properties. Therefore, no more than 2 litres + your Size of your bloodwine can exist at once.
One 250 ml drink of bloodwine by anyone else counts as 14 doses of alcohol. Drinking 250 ml of your own bloodwine counts as the number of doses of alcohol you desire. Pouring 750 ml of your bloodwine all over your own body instantly stabilizes all your wounds if you had no open wound. Covering a blade you wield in bloodwine (negligible amount of bloodwine spent, 250 ml required to make it work) makes it transmit 7 doses of alcohol to any creature it draws blood from. Those alcohol doses take effect immediately rather than one minute later.",,,,,,,,,,,

Every hour they can try that defense again to snap out of it before it ends. When someone refuses your invitation, you may sacrifice this blessing to subject them to the same effect as if they accepted.",,,,,,,,,,,

The only two effects of the alcohol you still suffer are the risks of damage and extended recovery when pass out drunk and the hangover. You lose the bonuses while hungover.",,,,,,,,,,,

With this effect, select a skill you have at least one Level in, a dialect you speak, a mastery or an advancement you have or a spell you know.

It can't move away, but statues can attack, grab or manipulate objects. All animated creatures, painted or sculpted have senses similar to humans, can talk, are intelligent and loyal to their creator. They will follow instructions you give them to the best of their ability. The base number for all Attributes they have (except Size) is 2, 3, 4 or 5, depending on their quality (bad, good, great and masterful) and they have +2 in two of them, depending on their nature. Their Size is determined by their actual Size. When sculptures attack, they do so with the weapons sculpted with them. They can take two actions per turn and can only make one reaction attack per round. They have no Stamina and use no proactive defenses.

You can freely summon a golden spear out of thin air. Your attacks and combat maneuvers against that person get a +2 bonus. You ignore all mental magical effects that would prevent you from pursuing them. You gain a new wrestling action against them: ""Arrest"". On a critical failure, they get a free wrestling action against you. On a great failure, regular failure or a match, nothing happens.

If the difficulty of the roll was between 1 higher and 1 lower than your skill score (before the bonus), you receive 5D Morale damage. If it was lower than that, you receive 8D Morale damage. If it was higher, you receive only 2D Morale damage. For output rolls (such as Running rolls made to dash), you determine the difficulty and success of a roll by naming in advance a point of success, and foregoing the possibility of using any out your output past that point (for example, you state where you want to end up at the end of your dash, succeed when you get there and can't go farther than that point even if you roll high enough).",,,,,,,,,,,

You can announce the rules and participants of a competition and announce that interfering or cheating will be severely punished by your god. If you do so and all the participants and most of the audience (if there is one) audibly approve or cheer, anyone who cheats or interferes with the competition is hit by Dyrephon's Smite (15D+15 internal damage).
You can announce a performance by an individual or a group, including you, to an audience and introduce the performers. If you do so, any 'great success' result by the performers on any roll for the performance is upgraded to a 'critical success'.
